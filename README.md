### How to test your module?

Disable PCH (precompiled headers) and try to compile. If you forgot some headers, it is time to add them !
To disable PCH, follow this [link](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/wiki/CMake-options) and set `USE_COREPCH ` to 0 with Cmake.

## Requirements

My new module requires:

- AzerothCore v1.0.1+


## Installation

```
1) Simply place the module under the `modules` directory of your AzerothCore source. 
2) Import the SQL manually to the right Database (auth, world or characters) or with the `db_assembler.sh` (if `include.sh` provided).
3) Re-run cmake and launch a clean build of AzerothCore.
```

## Edit module configuration (optional)

If you need to change the module configuration, go to your server configuration folder (where your `worldserver` or `worldserver.exe` is), copy `my_module.conf.dist` to `my_module.conf` and edit that new file.
